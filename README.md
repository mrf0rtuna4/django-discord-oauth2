## Overview

`django-discord-oauth2` is a Django app that simplifies integrating Discord's OAuth2 authentication. It provides a ready-to-use OAuth2 flow to authenticate users with their Discord accounts.

### ðŸš¨ Important Note on CSRF and Security  
While handling OAuth tokens, be cautious about CSRF vulnerabilities. CSRF protection may sometimes block unsafe token handling methods, especially when passing tokens directly to the database. It is essential to follow best practices by using secure storage and transmission methods for tokens.
